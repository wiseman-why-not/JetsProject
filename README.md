## Jets week 4 Project

### Overview

+ Create a fleet of jets with different capabilities. Your application will be a menu to use your jets and access information about them.

### Topics/Technologies Used

+ Java / Eclipse
+ Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation
+ Abstract and Interfaces
+ Used buffered reader and file reader to get information from a file

### Lesson Learned

+ Hardest thing to get working was to read information from a text file, separate the information into an array of Strings and then creating a jet constructor from the array.
+ First time doing Abstract and Interfaces in my program. Understanding abstract classes when designing and implementing classes to use them.
+ using Polymorphism to call an abstract class but depending on input taken. creating an object that is inherited from the super class.
+ first time using List and ArrayList<> in a project
+ Still trying to get get a better grasp on try catch blocks and having the user retry the input afterwards.
